- bits, nibbles, bytes and bases
- integer representation (twos complement and integer overflow)
- decimal number representation (floating point and fixed point)
- typical memory bugs (and how rust prevents them)
- what is meant by "random access"?
- how memory is laid out:
  - stack vs heap
  - static
  - why stack faster than the heap
- system calls
  - implement malloc
- implement garbage collector
- build a cpu emulator (CHIP-8 or 8080)
- race condition vs data race
